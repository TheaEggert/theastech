      <h2>Why YouTube shouldn't have disabled comments on automated music posts</h2>

      <p>There was a point in time in the mid 2010s when auto-generated "videos" of songs started popping-up on YouTube. These videos are just a static image of the song's album art. To me, this was basically YouTube becoming self-aware that people have been uploading static-image songs since around 2009. YouTube realized that if people navigate to YouTube to listen to music, it might as well upload music officially.
        <br><br>
        I quickly fell in love with this new part of YouTube. Many, many songs that no one had bothered to manually upload were now present on the site. This was great because even if someone had already uploaded a song, the audio was often subpar and/or the song was in music video form, meaning one had to skip parts. Since the automated song videos appear to be uploaded directly from an audio file, they are typically higher in audio quality than a user-uploaded version of the same song. But the best part was that since these uploads also counted as videos, there was a comment section. Therefore, unlike current streaming services, where discussion about music is virtually non-existent, one could listen to high-quality music while being able to discuss, say, the intricate parts of a certain song or what the song means to a person.
        <br><br>
        One day, YouTube disabled comments on nearly all of its automated song videos.
        <br><br>
        No discussion. No passionate anecdotes. Just the user--alone with the song. (Which is something streaming services already offer.)
        <br><br>
        This was a frustrating discovery to me. Why would they do something so senseless? Why copy every other platform? Wasn't offering a unique service what got YouTube popping off in the first place?
        <br><br>
        And so to this day I mourn the death of the comments section underneath automated song videos.
        <br><br>
        Rest In Participation.
